To install ADMesh, you will need a system with a c compiler.
Do the following:

1.  Get the file admesh-0.95.tar.gz
2.  Extract the archive.  i.e. type something like the following:
         tar -zxvf admesh-0.95.tar.gz
	 or if that doesn't work, try the following:
         cat admesh-0.95.tar.gz | gzip -d | tar xvf -
    The source files will be extracted into a directory called admesh-0.95
3.  cd admesh-0.95
4.  type the following:
         ./configure
	 make

That should do it.  You should have an executable file called admesh.  There
is only the one stand-alone executable and there are no configuration files
or environment variables to be set.  I don't believe that that the included
configure script will run under MS-DOS or Windows, so you will need to edit
the included Makefile.in file by hand to compile it.
